Hey! I'm Ralah Aaqil (pronounced ruh-la aah-kill, for the 99% of you reading this wondering how it's pronounced). I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at CMR Institute of Technology, Bangalore, pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. 

Wracking my brain at things that intrigue and confuse me is a hobby of mine. As an avid tech enthusiast, who is also fascinated by the workings of the human brain, it's no surprise that majority of the things I like to work on are based on Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Data Science. Irrespective of the difficulty of the topic, I do my best to apply the things I learn to real world scenarios to try and comprehend it better, while also gaining an understanding of it's applications.

Outside the academic bubble, I spend my time teaching the guitar, struming up a chord or two at a gig (or for my own satisfaction), exploring interesting new cuisines or hopping on a game with my friends. I friends consider me to be a 'bougie' coffee enthusiast with a penchant for the strongest perfumes (But I really just love the bottles).
