Hey! I'm Ralah Aaqil (pronounced ruh-la aah-kill for the 99% of you reading this wondering how it's pronounced). I am a fourth year undergraduate student at CMR Institute of Technology, Bangalore, pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. 

Wracking my brain at things that intrigue and confuse me is a usual hobby alongside others. Being an avid tech enthusiast who is also fascinated by the working of the human brain, it's no surprise that majority of the things I like to work on are based on Machine Learning or Data Science. Irrespective of the difficulty of the topic, I do my best to apply the things I learn in real world scenarios to try and comprehend it better while also gaining an understanding in it's applications.

Outside the academic bubble, I teach the guitar, strum up a chord or two for my own staisfaction, explore interesting new cuisines or hop on a game with my friends.
